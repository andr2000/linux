Subject: [PATCH v5 0/3] Input: xen-kbdfront - allow better run-time configuration

Hi, all!

This patch series synchronizes Xen canonical protocol definitions
which allow the last two patches in the series to update Xen
kbdfront driver with a fix and v5 of the patch to allow better
run-time configuration for xen-kbdfront.

As xen-kbdfront patches rely on protocol changes from patch 1 I am
sending these all together: Boris, Juergen, if you and Dmitry do not
mind, can we have patch 1 applied through Dmitry's tree?

Thank you,
Oleksandr

Changes since v4:
- Added required changes to Xen protocols
- Added a fix for multi-touch XenStore node's locations
- No changes to "Input: xen-kbdfront - allow better run-time
  configuration"

Changes since v3:
- do not connect backend if all virtual devices are disabled (Dmitry)

Changes since v2:
- based on XenStore kbdif features to control which devices are
  exposed instead of module parameters.
